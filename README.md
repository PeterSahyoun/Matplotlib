# Matplotlib
Python For Data Visualization

Matplotlib is a Python package used for 2D graphics.
It is a collection of command style functions that make matplotlib work like Matlab.
Human brain can process information easily when it is in pictorial or graphical form.

In 'matplotlib_lab.py' I have represented the following:
- Many types of plots (Simple graph, Bar graph, Histograms, Scatter Plot, Chart/Pie Plot, Stack/Area Plot).
- How to deal with multiple plots.
